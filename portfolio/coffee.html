                For the past century, much of the world has treated coffee
                as either a stimulant or a bitter ingredient in a dessert drink.
                Neither is necessarily inaccurate... However, recent movements
                in the specialty coffee sphere have sparked increased interest
                in the research and elevation of coffee <em>flavor</em> quality,
                from the agricultural side down to the retail & consumer realm.
                Using this (quite limited) dataset of coffee samples, I aim to
                explore the relationship between certain coffees' attributes (such as
                species, processing method, variety, and country of origin) and 
                their quality scores. Could certain plants, methods, and countries
                produce objectively "better" coffees? From there, one could then
                dive deeper into the economical, climate, political, social,
                and biological reasons why these relationships exist
                (unfortunately I do not have that data yet...). Further explorations
                of this data could also be used to help small farmers make decisions
                that increase the value of their product. Also- the data I'm
                using seems to sample almost exclusively high-quality coffees, so
                results are highly biased and not representative of all coffees.

                The following figures are made using data that comes from the 
                <a href="https://database.coffeeinstitute.org/coffees/arabica" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) database,</a>
                scraped and uploaded to

                by myself in December 2022.<br>
                It contains data on roughly 1,300 Arabica coffee samples,
                including cupping quality scores, which are standardized by the
                <a href="https://sca.coffee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Specialty Coffee Association (SCA).</a>

                of each attribute and metric can be found
