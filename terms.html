            <h2>13. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h2>
            
            <h3>Informal Negotiations</h3>

            <p>To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms 
            (each a "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or me (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), 
            the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at 
            least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. 
            Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.</p>

            <h3>Binding Arbitration</h3>

            <p>If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) 
            will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. 
            YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. 
            The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association 
            ("<abbr title="American Arbitration Association">AAA</abbr>") 
            and, where appropriate, the 
            <abbr title="American Arbitration Association">AAA</abbr>'s 
            Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes 
            ("<abbr title="American Arbitration Association">AAA</abbr> 
            Consumer Rules"), 
            both of which are available at the 
            <a href="http://www.adr.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">American Arbitration Association (AAA) website</a>. 
            Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the 
            <abbr title="American Arbitration Association">AAA</abbr> 
            Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, 
            limited by the 
            <abbr title="American Arbitration Association">AAA</abbr> 
            Consumer Rules. 
            The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. 
            The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. 
            The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. 
            Except where otherwise required by the applicable 
            <abbr title="American Arbitration Association">AAA</abbr> 
            rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in Douglas, Kansas. 
            Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, 
            or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</p>

            <p>If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the 
            state and federal courts located in Douglas, Kansas, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of 
            personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. 
            Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer 
            Information Transaction Act 
            (<abbr title="Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act">UCITA</abbr>) 
            are excluded from these Legal Terms.</p>

            <p>In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Services be commenced more than one 
            (1) years after the cause of action arose. 
            If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within 
            that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent 
            jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>

            <h3>Restrictions</h3>

            <p>The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. 
            To the full extent permitted by law, 
            (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; 
            (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and 
            (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public 
            or any other persons.</p>

            <h3>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h3>

            <p>The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration: 
            (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; 
            (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and 
            (c) any claim for injunctive relief. 
            If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within
            that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent 
            jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>
