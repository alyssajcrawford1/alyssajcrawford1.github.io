        <p>This Cookie Policy explains how Alyssa Crawford ("I," "me," and "my") uses cookies and 
        similar technologies to recognize you when you visit my website at 
        <a href="https://alyssajcrawford.gay" target="_blank">https://alyssajcrawford.gay</a>
        ("Website").
        It explains what these technologies are and why I use them, 
        as well as your rights to control my use of them.
        n some cases I may use cookies to collect personal information, 
        or that becomes personal information if I combine it with other information.</p>
        
        <h2>What are cookies?</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. 
        Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, 
        as well as to provide reporting information.</p>
        
        <p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Alyssa Crawford) are called "first-party cookies." 
        Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." 
        Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website 
        (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). 
        The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website 
        in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>
        
        <h2>Why do I use cookies?</h2>
        <p>I use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. 
        Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for my Website to operate, 
        and I refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. 
        Other cookies also enable me to track and target the interests of my users to enhance 
        the experience on my Online Properties. 
        Third parties serve cookies through my Website for analytics and other purposes. 
        This is described in more detail below.</p>
        
        <h2>How can I control cookies?</h2>
        <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies.
        You can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. 
        The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. 
        Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.
        The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on my website. 
        If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use my website though your access to some functionality 
        and areas of my website may be restricted. 
        You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.
        The specific types of first- and third-party cookies served through my Website and the purposes they 
        perform are described in the table below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending 
        on the specific Online Properties you visit):</p>
        <h3>Analytics and customization cookies:</h3>
        <p>These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help me understand how my 
        Website is being used or how effective my marketing campaigns are, or to help me customize my Website for you.</p>

        <h2>How can I control cookies on my browser?</h2>
        <p>As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary 
        from browser to browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information. 
        The following is information about how to manage cookies on the most popular browsers:</p>

        <h2>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h2>
        <p>Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. 
        I may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons 
        (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). 
        These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enables me to 
        recognize when someone has visited my Website or opened an email including them. 
        This allows me, for example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page 
        within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand 
        whether you have come to the website from a third-party website, or
        to improve site performance. 
        In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, 
        and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.</p>
        
        <h2>Do you serve targeted advertising?</h2>
        <p>Third parties are not able to serve advertising through my Website, and thereby will not 
        serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to do so.</p>
        
        <h2>How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</h2>
        <p>I may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, 
        changes to the cookies I use or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. 
        Please therefore revisit this Cookie Policy regularly to stay informed about my use 
        of cookies and related technologies.
        The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last updated.</p>
        
        <h2>Where can I get further information?</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about my use of cookies or other technologies, please contact me by email at
        <a href="mailto:alyssajcrawford1@gmail.com">alyssajcrawford1@gmail.com</a>,
