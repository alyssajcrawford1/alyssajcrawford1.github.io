            <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong>
            I collect personal information that you provide to me.</em></p>
            
            <p>I collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to me when you express an interest in obtaining 
            information about me or my products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, 
            or otherwise when you contact me.</p>

            <h4>Sensitive Information.</h4>
            <p>I do not process sensitive information.</p>

            <p>All personal information that you provide to me must be true, complete, and accurate,

            <h3>Information automatically collected</h3>
            <h4><strong>In Short:</strong>
            Some information — such as your Internet Protocol

            address and/or browser and device characteristics — 
            is collected automatically when you visit my Services.</h4>
            
            <p>I automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. 
            This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) 
            but may include device and usage information, such as your 
            <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr>
            address, browser and device characteristics, 
            operating system, language preferences, referring 
            <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr>, 
            device name, country, location, 
            information about how and when you use my Services, and other technical information.
            This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of my Services, 
            and for my internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>

            <p>Like many businesses, I also collect information through cookies and similar technologies. 
            You can find out more about this in my Cookie Notice:

                <dt>Log and Usage Data.</dt>
                <dd>Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information 
                my servers automatically collect when you access or use my Services and which I record in log files. 
                Depending on how you interact with me, this log data may include your 
                <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr>
                address, device information, 
                browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services
                (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, 
                and other actions you take such as which features you use), 
                device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware settings).</dd>

                <dt>Device Data.</dt>
                <dd>I collect device data such as information about your computer, phone, tablet, or other device you use to access the Services. 
                Depending on the device used, this device data may include information such as your 
                <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> 
                address (or proxy server), 
                device and application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware model, 
                Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating system, and system configuration information.</dd>

                <dt>Location Data.</dt>
                <dd>I collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. 
                How much information I collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. 
                For example, I may use 
                <abbr title="Global Positioning System">GPS</abbr>
                and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells me your current location 
                (based on your 
                <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> 
                address). 
                You can opt out of allowing me to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by 
                disabling your Location setting on your device. 
                However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</dd>

            <h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO I RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

            <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong>
            I only process your personal information when I believe it is necessary and I have a valid legal reason (i.e.,
            legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or 
            fulfill my contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill
            my legitimate business interests.</em></p>

            <em><u>If you are located in the

            <p>The General Data Protection Regulation 
            (<abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr>)
            and 
            <abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr> 
            <abbr title="General Data Protection Regulation">GDPR</abbr> 
            require me to explain the valid legal bases I 
            rely on in order to process your personal information. 
            As such, I may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>

            <dl>
                <dt>Consent.</dt>
                <dd>I may process your information if you have given me permission (i.e.,
                consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. 
                You can withdraw your consent at any time.</dd>

                <dt>Legitimate Interests.</dt>
                <dd>I may process your information when I believe it is reasonably necessary to achieve my 
                legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and 
                fundamental rights and freedoms. 
                For example, I may process your personal information for some of the purposes described in order to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Analyze how my Services are used so I can improve them to engage and retain users</li>
                    <li>Diagnose problems and/or prevent fraudulent activities.</li>
                </ul>
                </dd>

                <dt>Legal Obligations.</dt>
                <dd>I may process your information where I believe it is necessary for compliance with my legal obligations, 
                such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend my legal rights, 
                or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which I am involved.</dd>

                <dt>Vital Interests.</dt>
                <dd>I may process your information where I believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the 
                vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person.</dd>
            </dl>

            <em><u>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</u></em>

            <p>I may process your information if you have given me specific permission 
            (<abbr title="id est; that is">i.e.</abbr>, express consent)
            to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred
            (<abbr title="id est; that is">i.e.</abbr>, implied consent). 
            You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>

            <p>In some exceptional cases, I may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
                <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
                <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
                <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
                <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
                <li>If I have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
                <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information 
                    and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
                <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
                <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which 
                    the information was produced</li>
                <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>

            <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong>
            I aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>
            
            <p>I have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational
            security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information I process. 
            However, despite my safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the 
            Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so I cannot promise or guarantee 
            that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat my security and 
            improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. 
            Although I will do my best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and 
            from my Services is at your own risk.
            You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
